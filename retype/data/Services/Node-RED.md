# Node-RED

This is a Low-code programming application for event-driven applications. On top of Node-RED the container uses a Node-RED Dashboard this is automatically installed. This container provides a set of nodes in Node-RED to quickly create a live data dashboard. for information on how this works, please refer to the offical documentation page of this module.

## Dashboard UI

This is for now a simple dashboard where users can navigate between Node-RED and the Node-RED Dashboard. In the future this can serve more purposes, but for now its basically a gateway to the available services.

## Accessibility

You can access Node-RED via the following urls:

### Node-RED

- Via localhost (original port): [localhost:1880](http://localhost:1880)

### Node-RED Dashboard UI

- Via localhost (original port): [localhost:1880/ui](http://localhost:1880/ui)
