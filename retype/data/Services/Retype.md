# Retype

Retype is an ‚ú® ultra-high-performance ‚ú® generator that builds a website based on simple text files. Focus on your writing while Retype builds the rest.

No coding is required and just one Markdown file, such as a README.md, will get you started.

This website was generated using Retype.

A new Retype powered website can be up and running within seconds once Retype is installed, which itself takes only a few seconds. üëç
